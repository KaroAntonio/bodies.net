The human body includes the entire structure of a human being and comprises 
a head, neck, trunk 
(which includes the thorax and abdomen), 
arms and hands, legs and feet. 
Every part of the body is composed of various types of cells, 
the fundamental unit of life.
At maturity, the estimated average number of cells in the body is given as 
37.2 trillion. 
This number is stated to be of partial data and to be used as a starting point for further calculations. 
The number given is arrived at by totalling the cell numbers of all the organs of the body and cell types. 
The composition of the human body is made up of a number of 
certain elements including carbon, calcium and phosphorus.
The study of the human body involves anatomy and physiology. The human body can show anatomical non-pathological anomalies known as variations 
which need to be able to be recognised. 
Physiology focuses on the systems and their organs of the human body and their functions. 
Many systems and mechanisms interact in order to maintain homeostasis.
